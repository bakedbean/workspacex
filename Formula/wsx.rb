  # wsx shells out to `git` and drives git worktrees, so git is a hard
  # runtime requirement. It is not declared as a dependency because macOS
  # ships git and Homebrew itself needs it on Linux, so it is always
  # present. The same reasoning is why lazygit and jj do not declare it.
  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      wsx needs `git` on your PATH.

      wsx reads pull request state through the GitHub CLI. Install it to see
      PR numbers and review marks on the dashboard:
        brew install gh
    EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_match "wsx #{version}", shell_output("#{bin}/wsx --version")
